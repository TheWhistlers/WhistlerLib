## A library for serializing and deserializing WAML files.

### *__What's the WAML?__*
&emsp;&emsp;The WAML stands for "Whistler is Able to Mark up Language". And The original intention of the design is I (Whistler) want to store data in my own ways, so I begin this Project.

### *__How can I learn it?__*
&emsp;&emsp;If you want to know more, [Click here to the official website](https://TheWhistlers.github.io/WhistlerLib). And the Document and Example is on it.

### *__Can I use it for business?__*
&emsp;&emsp;Of course! You can use it no matter where! Because I used the [MIT license](https://mit-license.org). And one of the original intention of the design is that it can be used widely, so use me boldly!

### *__What situation should I use it in?__*
&emsp;&emsp;When you want to save your data into waml files, or when you want to try something new. You can use it!

### *__How many kinds of Languages does it support?__*
&emsp;&emsp;Recently, it will support Java for a long time, and in fact. I'm a C# user, so maybe I will make a .Net version in half a year. But first of all, I want to make the Java version perfect.  
&emsp;&emsp;If you want to make another language version. Just Do it!  
&emsp;&emsp;Can you [@me](https://github.com/TheWhistlers) if you do that? ([My Bilibili Channel](https://space.bilibili.com/456635939))

### *__What's the WAML syntax?__*
&emsp;&emsp;You can find it in the [offical website](https://TheWhistlers.github.io/WhistlerLib/Documents). Actually, it's not hard to study. You can even study it easily! (because I'm not the devil of the programming!)
